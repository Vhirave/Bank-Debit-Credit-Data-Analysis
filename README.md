**Project Title:** Bank Credit and Debit Data Analysis

**Project Description:**
This project involves analyzing the bank’s credit and debit data to provide valuable insights into financial transactions and trends. Using raw transactional data from the bank, an interactive dashboard was developed to track, monitor, and visualize key financial metrics. The analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior, transaction volumes, and overall cash flow.

The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs), visualizations like charts and graphs, and filter options to drill down into specific time periods, customer segments, and transaction types. Tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau were utilized to present the data, while MySQL was used to process and clean the data. The analysis aims to assist the bank in making informed decisions regarding customer transactions, identifying trends in credit and debit activity, and optimizing overall financial performance.
